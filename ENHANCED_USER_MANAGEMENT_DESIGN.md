# Credentials are isolated in separate processes
UserSupervisor -> CredentialManager (isolated process)
                -> UserConnection (trading operations)
                -> UserHealthMonitor (monitoring)
```

**Security Measures**:
- Credentials never stored in logs or error messages
- Separate process memory space for credential storage
- Automatic secure purging on disconnection
- HMAC-SHA256 signature generation without key exposure
- Credential format validation (64-char Binance API keys)

### 3.2 Audit Trail

**Comprehensive Logging** (without credential exposure):
- Connection attempts with rejection reasons
- Credential lifecycle events (created, updated, purged)
- Authentication successes and failures
- Rate limiting violations
- Suspicious activity detection
- Process failures and recoveries

**Security Health Scoring**:
- Real-time security health calculation
- Based on recent security events
- Automatic alerts for critical issues
- Integration with monitoring dashboards

### 3.3 Access Control

**Process-Level Isolation**:
- Each user has isolated process subtree
- Credentials accessible only within user's CredentialManager
- Registry-based process discovery with access controls
- Automatic cleanup of terminated processes

## 4. Fault Tolerance Integration

### 4.1 Integration with Phase 2 Infrastructure

**Circuit Breaker Integration**:
- User connections participate in system-wide circuit breaker
- Individual user failures don't trigger circuit breaker
- Graceful degradation during system stress

**Exponential Backoff**:
- Per-user connection retry with exponential backoff
- Respects Binance rate limits (1s → 30s max)
- Jitter to prevent thundering herd

**Health Monitoring**:
- User sessions integrate with HealthMonitor
- Per-user health status tracking
- System-wide health impact assessment

### 4.2 User Session Fault Tolerance

```
UserManager (DynamicSupervisor)
└── UserSupervisor (per user, temporary restart)
    ├── UserConnection (temporary restart)

    └── UserHealthMonitor (temporary restart)
```

**Failure Handling**:
- Individual user failures don't affect other users
